Xpressive visualiser

does not render integrate(w1(f)) properly
speed incorrect
transfer functions incorrect

Uses (inside this repository):
- C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit Library, Author: Arash Partow (1999-2025) URL: https://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html
- Xpressive.cpp and Xpressive.h, Author: Orr Dvori (2016-2017 Orr Dvori) URL: https://lmms.io

Uses ideas elicited from both authors code placed into main.cpp to convert the expressions into waveforms
